Negative coefficient -1 and -3 is like a pull back to normal. If the city council spend more, there is a certain poll yelling to spend less. -3 means city in New Hamsphire is more sensitive to change of budget. Coefficient b, c is like responding to other city's budget. If b is small, Massachusett follows a little of budget New Hamsphire.\n",
