    "1. Look for critical points of the system, $(x_0, y_0)$ where $f(x_0, y_0) = 0$ and $g(x_0, y_0) = 0$. Start at position zero with velocity zero. This solves the system as $x = x_0, y = y_0$, sit rest, for all time\n",

    "This means pendulum starts at bottom and sitting rest. Another point is pendulum at the top and sitting rest. Physically, point $(0, 0)$ is stable critical point where $(\\pi, 0)$ is unstable. Basically just two critical points.\n",
